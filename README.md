# Lightshow
Lightshow is an app that allows you to test the individual LEDs on your Xbox 360's Ring of Light (ROL) as well as the center power LED.

## Usage

Hold the Left Stick in the direction of the LED you'd like to modify and press a button to change the color to green, yellow, red, or off.

Press Start to toggle the center LED on or off.

If all ROL LEDs are set to off and a controller is connected, the system will turn Player 1's LED to green. This is a feature of the system, and cannot be overridden by the app.
